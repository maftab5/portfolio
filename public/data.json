Always helping and contributing with great ideas and even better questions to challenge mine and his knowledge. To me, that is a sign of a student looking to name for themselves by proving their abilities through hard work. Great job Mohammad and all the best!\n-John\rPrinz\nHead\rof\rDepartment\nConestoga\rCollege"
